// Be Concise I - The Ternary Operator
// You are given a function describeAge / describe_age that takes a parameter age (which will always be a positive integer) and does the following:
//
// If the age is 12 or lower, it return "You're a(n) kid"
// If the age is anything between 13 and 17 (inclusive), it return "You're a(n) teenager"
// If the age is anything between 18 and 64 (inclusive), it return "You're a(n) adult"
// If the age is 65 or above, it return "You're a(n) elderly"
// Your task is to shorten the code as much as possible. Note that submitting the given code will not work because there is a character limit of 137.
//
// I'll give you a few hints:
//
// The title itself is a hint - if you're not sure what to do, always research any terminology in this description that you have not heard of!
// Don't you think the whole "You're a(n) <insert_something_here>" is very repetitive? ;) Perhaps we can shorten it?
// Write everything in one line, \n and other whitespaces counts.
// Whatever you do, do not change what the function does. Good luck :)

// function describeAge(age) {
//   if (age <= 12) {
//     return "You're a(n) kid";
//   } else if (age >= 13 && age <= 17) {
//     return "You're a(n) teenager";
//   } else if (age >= 18 && age <= 64) {
//     return "You're a(n) adult";
//   } else {
//     return "You're a(n) elderly";
//   }
// }

const describeAge = age => (age <= 12) ? "You're a(n) kid" : (age >= 13 && age <= 17) ? "You're a(n) teenager" : (age >= 18 && age <= 64) ? "You're a(n) adult" : "You're a(n) elderly"
