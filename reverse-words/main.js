// This Kata is intended as a small challenge for my students

// All Star Code Challenge #29

// Your friend Nhoj has dislexia, but can easily read messages if the words are written backwards.
// Create a function called reverseSentence()/reverse_sentence() that accepts a string argument. The function returns a string of the same length with each word reversed, but still in their original order.

// reverseSentence("Hello !Nhoj Want to have lunch?"); // => 'olleH johN! tnaW ot evah ?hcnul'
// Note:
// A "word" should be considered a string split by a space character, " " Letter capitalization should be maintained.

function reverseSentence(str){
    //code here
      let wordArr = str.split(' ')
     return wordArr.map(word=>word.split('').reverse().join('')).join(' ')
    }
