// Definition
// An element is leader if it is greater than The Sum all the elements to its right side.

// Task
// Given an array/list [] of integers , Find all the LEADERS in the array.

// Notes
// Array/list size is at least 3 .

// Array/list's numbers Will be mixture of positives , negatives and zeros

// Repetition of numbers in the array/list could occur.

// Returned Array/list should store the leading numbers in the same order in the original array/list .

// Input >> Output Examples
// arrayLeaders ({1, 2, 3, 4, 0}) ==> return {4}
// Explanation:
// 4 is greater than the sum all the elements to its right side

// Note : The last element 0 is equal to right sum of its elements (abstract zero).

// arrayLeaders ({16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2}) ==> return {17, 5, 2}
// Explanation:
// 17 is greater than the sum all the elements to its right side

// 5 is greater than the sum all the elements to its right side

// Note : The last element 2 is greater than the sum of its right elements (abstract zero).

// arrayLeaders ({5, 2, -1}) ==> return {5, 2}
// Explanation:
// 5 is greater than the sum all the elements to its right side

// 2 is greater than the sum all the elements to its right side

// Note : The last element -1 is less than the sum of its right elements (abstract zero).

// arrayLeaders ({0, -1, -29, 3, 2}) ==> return {0, -1, 3, 2}
// Explanation:
// 0 is greater than the sum all the elements to its right side

// -1 is greater than the sum all the elements to its right side

// 3 is greater than the sum all the elements to its right side

// Note : The last element 2 is greater than the sum of its right elements (abstract zero).

const arrayLeaders = numbers =>
  numbers.filter((number, index) => {
    const totalRight = numbers.slice(index + 1).reduce((total, number) => total + number, 0)
    return number > totalRight
  })

// more readable but above is linear time complexity and below is quadratic. above will be faster as the input gets larger
var arrayLeaders = numbers => {
    let answer = [];
  
    for (let i=0; i<numbers.length; i++){          //loop through array
      let sum = 0;
      for (let j=i+1; j<numbers.length; j++){      //start one position right of the main loop element
        sum += numbers[j];                         //add all those numbers together
      }
      
      if(numbers[i] > sum){                        //compare that sum to the initial number
        answer.push(numbers[i]);                   //if it's bigger push it to the answer array
      }
    }
    return answer;                                 //return it like it's defective
