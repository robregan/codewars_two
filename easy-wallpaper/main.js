// John wants to decorate a room with wallpaper. He wants a fool-proof method for getting it right.
// John knows that the rectangular room has a length of l meters, a width of w meters, a height of h meters. The standard width of the rolls he wants to buy is 52 centimeters. The length of a roll is 10 meters. He bears in mind however, that itâ€™s best to have an extra length of wallpaper handy in case of mistakes or miscalculations so he wants to buy a length 15% greater than the one he needs.
// Last time he did these calculations he got a headache, so could you help John?
// Task
// Your function wallpaper(l, w, h) should return as a plain English word in lower case the number of rolls he must buy.

// Example:
// wallpaper(4.0, 3.5, 3.0) should return "ten"

// wallpaper(0.0, 3.5, 3.0) should return "zero"




function wallpaper(l, w, h) {
    const numbers = ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five',
                    'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine', 'ten', 'eleven',
                    'twelve', 'thirteen', 'fourteen', 'fifteen',
                    'sixteen', 'seventeen', 'eighteen', 'nineteen', 'twenty'];
    return w * h * l === 0 ? numbers[0] : numbers[Math.ceil((l * h * 2 + w * h * 2) * 1.15 / 5.2)]
}
