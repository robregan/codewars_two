// Description:
// In the following 6 digit number:
// 283910
// 91 is the greatest sequence of 2 consecutive digits.
// In the following 10 digit number:
// 1234567890
// 67890 is the greatest sequence of 5 consecutive digits.
// Complete the solution so that it returns the greatest sequence of five consecutive digits found within the number given. The number will be passed in as a string of only digits. It should return a five digit integer. The number passed may be as large as 1000 digits.
