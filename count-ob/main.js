// You will be given an array of objects representing data about developers who have signed up to attend the next coding meetup that you are organising.

// Your task is to return an object which includes the count of food options selected by the developers on the meetup sign-up form..

// For example, given the following input array:

// var list1 = [
//   { firstName: 'Noah', lastName: 'M.', country: 'Switzerland', continent: 'Europe', age: 19, language: 'C', 
//     meal: 'vegetarian' },
//   { firstName: 'Anna', lastName: 'R.', country: 'Liechtenstein', continent: 'Europe', age: 52, language: 'JavaScript', 
//     meal: 'standard' },
//   { firstName: 'Ramona', lastName: 'R.', country: 'Paraguay', continent: 'Americas', age: 29, language: 'Ruby', 
//     meal: 'vegan' },
//   { firstName: 'George', lastName: 'B.', country: 'England', continent: 'Europe', age: 81, language: 'C', 
//     meal: 'vegetarian' },
// ];
// your function should return the following object (the order of properties does not matter):

// { vegetarian: 2, standard: 1, vegan: 1 }
// Notes:

// The order of the meals count in the object does not matter.
// The count value should be a valid number.
// The input array will always be valid and formatted as in the example above.
// there are 5 possible meal options and the strings representing the selected meal option will always be formatted in the same way, as follows: 'standard', 'vegetarian', 'vegan', 'diabetic', 'gluten-intolerant'.




// This kata is part of the Coding Meetup series which includes a number of short and easy to follow katas which have been designed to allow mastering the use of higher-order functions. In JavaScript this includes methods like: forEach, filter, map, reduce, some, every, find, findIndex. Other approaches to solving the katas are of course possible.

function orderFood(list) {
    // thank you for checking out the Coding Meetup kata :)
    let count = {}
    list.forEach(val=>count[val.meal]= (count[val.meal]||0)+1)
    return count
  }
//
function orderFood(list) {
    var orders = {};
    list.forEach(d=>{
      if(orders[d.meal]) orders[d.meal]++;
      else orders[d.meal] = 1;
    });
    return orders;
  }
  //w reduce 
  const orderFood = a => a.reduce( (acc,v) => ( acc[v.meal] = ( acc[v.meal] || 0 ) + 1, acc ), {} )
