// You have to create a method "compoundArray" which should take as input two int arrays of different length and return one int array with numbers of both arrays shuffled one by one.

// Input - {1,2,3,4,5,6} and {9,8,7,6} 
// Output - {1,9,2,8,3,7,4,6,5,6}

function compoundArray(a, b) {
    let arr=[];
   for (let i=0; i< (a.length > b.length ? a.length:b.length); i++){ 
    arr.push(a[i], b[i])
    }
    return arr.filter(v=>v!=undefined)
  }
