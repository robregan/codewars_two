// Bob is a theoretical coder - he doesn't write code, but comes up with theories, formulas and algorithm ideas. You are his secretary, and he has tasked you with writing the code for his newest project - a method for making the short form of a word. Write a function shortForm(C# ShortForm, Python short_form) that takes a string and returns it converted into short form using the rule: Remove all vowels, except for those that are the first or last letter. Do not count 'y' as a vowel, and ignore case. Also note, the string given will not have any spaces; only one word, and only Roman letters.
// Example:

// shortForm("assault");
// short_form("assault")
// ShortForm("assault");
// // should return "asslt"

const shortForm = string => string.replace(/\B[aeiou]\B/gi, '')

// 
function shortForm(str) {
    return str[0] + 
      str.slice(1, -1).replace(/[aeoui]/gi, '') + 
      str.slice(-1)
  }
